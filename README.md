## Overview

### The challenge

Display your social media profile elegantly with this profile card component. Users can view their profile information in a structured manner, including followers, posts, and tags, all presented in a responsive layout.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This was a very easy, direct, simplistic and beginner friendly project that I would recommend as a first project for every developer when it comes to getting your hands dirty after learning concepts through tutorials and bootcamp courses.

This project has an interactive layout and uses flexbox to implement along with special features implemented through further advanced concepts in CSS as shown below in code snippet-

```css
.card-header {
    width:100%;
    height:140px;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
    background: url("./images/bg-pattern-card.svg");
}

.card-info {
    height:calc(100% - 140px);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
}

.profile-picture {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    border: 5px solid white;
    background: url("./images/image-victor.jpg");
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in JavaScript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
